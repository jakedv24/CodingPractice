--------- INTRO ----------
****THE BASE CODE IS SAVED IN TODO.java, USE THE FILE [NAME].java IN THE SOLUTIONS FOLDER TO WORK/TURN IN YOUR CODE.****

In this problem, you are given an empty class file called TODO (in the file TODO.java, duh, remember that hopefully ALWAYS, Class files are named the same as the class name).

Make sure to change this to your name for submission purposes.

This class holds the logic of various conditional problems.

I'm not going to explain any more about the class. I want you to look at the javadoc comments provided in the files and figure it out based on the specs given there.

I would suggest creating a new package for each practice problem, this one should be titled 'conditionalStatements'.

You are expected to comment everything you write and use perfect syntax (it will help me tremendously as well as yourself in the long run).

**IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS**, please raise an issue, and I will be happy to help you. I won't give you the answer but I will vaguely point you in the right direction with general hints/reminders. Ultimately, it is on you to figure it out, and this will solidify your knowledge.
--------------------------

--------- GOAL -----------
In the TODO.java file, there is skeleton code for various methods. NOTICE that they are all static, and remember that means they DO NOT require any other information other than their arguements. They don't need instance variables. Each problem is unique and you'll need to use conditionals and sometimes loops in the problems. You DON'T NEED TO print anything in a main method to turn in for this problem. HOWEVER, you should print/test your own code before submitting. If you want more clarification on certain methods, raise an issue.
--------------------------

------ WHEN FINISHED -----
Make a merge request with the 'master' branch. I will review/test your code, comment feedback, then will either accept or deny your merge request.
