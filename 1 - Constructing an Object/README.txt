--------- INTRO ----------
In this problem, you are given a class called PoolBall (in the file PoolBall.java, duh, remember that hopefully ALWAYS, Class files are named the same as the class name).

This class holds the logic of a single pool ball in a game of pool/billiards.

I'm not going to explain any more about the Class. I want you to look at the javadoc comments provided in the files and figure it our based on that info/the method information.

I would suggest creating a new package for each practice problem, this one should be titled 'constructingAnObject'.

You are expected to comment everything you write and use perfect syntax (it will help me tremendously as well as yourself in the long run).

**IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS**, please raise an issue, and I will be happy to help you. I won't give you the answer but I will vaguely point you in the right direction with general hints/reminders. Ultimately, it is on you to figure it out, and this will solidify your knowledge.
--------------------------

--------- GOAL -----------
In the ~TODO.java file, there is an empty 'main' method. Your goal is to construct a PoolBall object, then print a single line with information about the ball (format below).

FORMAT (AKA What your console output should look like): "Pool ball #[insert ball number here], color: [insert color here]"

**PLEASE NOTE**, The quotations and brackets are NOT meant to represent Java syntax in this example.

EXAMPLE:
Given that you constructed your PoolBall with number 35 and color cyan, as one does, your console will output: "Pool ball #35, color: cyan"

------ WHEN FINISHED -----
Make a merge request with the 'master' branch. I will review/test your code, comment feedback, then will either accept or deny your merge request.
